# Motivation


The dataset for this challenge was generated by giving gpt3.5 snippets of text on a range of scientific topics pulled from wikipedia, and asking it to write a multiple choice question (with a known answer), then filtering out easy questions.

An idea is to make this challenge a little easier by converting it to an open book science exam using semantic search and Wikipedia.
